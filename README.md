# Project Information
    In this challenge I created my own portfolio from scratch, which includes a small section about me personally, a navigation bar that operates successfully to direct users to my About Me section, previous works section, contact section, and an option to email me directly. I have also created media queries for various screens and devices to present responsive layout on different screen sizes.

## Requirements
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
